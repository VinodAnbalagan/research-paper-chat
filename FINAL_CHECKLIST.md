### Take 1: Introduction
"Hi, I'm Vinod, a machine learning student at University of Toronto. For Google's 5-Day AI Agents Intensive, I built a multi-agent system that helps researchers understand papers faster. Let me show you how it works."

### Take 2: Demo Walkthrough
1. Open app → "Here's the interface"
2. Upload paper → "I'm uploading a reinforcement learning paper"
3. Process → "The system extracts sections automatically"
4. Click Math Agent → "Watch as the Math agent explains this equation"
5. Show response → "Notice how it breaks down the formula step-by-step"
6. Switch to Chat → "You can also ask follow-up questions"
7. Ask question → "What's the training algorithm?"
8. Show response → "And it gives contextual answers"
9. Generate quiz → "Finally, test your understanding with auto-generated questions"

### Take 3: Technical Overview
"Under the hood, this uses 5 specialized agents coordinated by a Manager agent. Built with Google Gemini 2.0 Flash, deployed on Streamlit Cloud, costs about $0.001 per query."

### Take 4: Wrap Up
